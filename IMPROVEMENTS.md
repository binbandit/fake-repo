# Git Test Repository Improvements

## Summary of New Features Added

This fake repository has been enhanced with numerous advanced git scenarios for comprehensive testing:

### 1. Complex Git Operations
- **Empty Commits** - Testing edge cases with commits that have no changes
- **Cherry-picked Commits** - Commits with -x flag showing their origin
- **Revert Commits** - Both clean reverts and those that would conflict
- **Octopus Merge** - A merge commit with 3 parent branches

### 2. Large File Handling
- **Git LFS Configuration** - Tracking *.psd, *.zip, *.mov files
- **Large Binary Files** - 5MB binary file in assets/large/
- **LFS Pointer Files** - Mock PSD and zip archives

### 3. Advanced File Operations
- **Symbolic Links** - Links to files, directories, and broken links
- **File Permissions** - Executable bit changes on shell scripts
- **.gitattributes** - Line ending handling and merge strategies

### 4. Branch Naming Edge Cases
- **Unicode Branch Names** - Including emojis and non-ASCII characters
  - `feature/üöÄ-unicode-ÊµãËØï-√©mojis`
  - `bugfix/–ø–æ—Ñ–∏–∫—Å–∏—Ç—å-–±–∞–≥-üêõ`
- **Very Long Branch Names** - Testing UI display limits
  - `feature/this-is-an-extremely-long-branch-name-that-tests-the-limits...`

### 5. Git Hooks
- **Pre-commit Hook** - Checks for trailing whitespace and console.log
- **Commit-msg Hook** - Enforces conventional commit format

### 6. Submodules
- **Simulated Submodules** - .gitmodules configuration with two modules
- **Nested Structure** - lib/shared-utils and lib/auth-module

### 7. Multiple Authors
The repository now includes commits from:
- crazywolf132
- Sarah Chen
- Michael Johnson
- Emily Rodriguez
- David Kim
- Jessica Martinez

### 8. Temporal Consistency
All new commits follow a logical timeline from February 2024, maintaining realistic timestamps and author patterns.

## Testing Capabilities

This enhanced repository now allows testing of:
- Git wrapper handling of unicode and special characters
- Large file and Git LFS operations
- Complex merge scenarios (octopus merges)
- Hook execution and bypass
- Symbolic link handling across platforms
- File permission tracking
- Cherry-pick and revert operations
- Empty commit edge cases
- Submodule operations

The repository maintains its original purpose while adding significant depth for testing advanced git operations that real-world tools need to handle.
